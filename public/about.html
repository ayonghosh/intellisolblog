<div class="heading">About Me</div>

	<p>
		Hi, I'm Ayon--an author, artist, music producer, coder and nerd. 
		Everything other than the coder part is amateur, but only in spirit; I believe  
		I handle each of my avocation/vocation with a lot of passion.
	</p>
	<p>
		So what do I do for a living? I develop applications for desktop, 
		mobile and web. That leaves me just enough time to ponder over the 
		mysteries of the universe and the meaning of life. As you might have
		guessed by now,	I have come to realize the Answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, 
		the Universe, and Everything. No, it's not the number 42, and of course, I'm 
		not gonna tell you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wanna know more? Just drop me a line and I'll be more than happy to talk  
		to you for hours about technology, arts, movies, music and some serious philosophy,  
		but no: I'm still not gonna tell you the answer to the Ultimate Question. 
		So, good luck finding!
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, here's a quote of mine: <i>"Good enough is not good enough!"</i>
